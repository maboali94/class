45.	RRs??
46.	Split-horizon DNS?
47.	Sticky bit is a special permission to grant only the owner of file within directory to delete or rename file
48.	Immutable bit restricts certain operations on a file
49.	Symlinks are pointers to files meanwhile hardlinks creates an exact copy of file. If source is removed, symlink is gone since it’s linked but hardlink still exists since it created a copy.
50.	Inode stores all info associated with file except name and actual data. Inode contains device ID, group ID, user ID, and file permissions.
51.	Force/trigger file ???
52.	SNMP ??
53.	Runlevel is current state of OS and are numbered 0 thru 6. Who -r is command to determine current runlevel
54.	SSH port forwarding allows user to create encrypted connections between a local computer and a remote server while forwarding network traffic between them.
55.	Local port forwarding allows you to securely access a sevice running on a remote server from local computer. Remote port forwarding allows you to display a service running on local computer to the remote server.

60.	Excess cache memory & filesystem journaling 
61.	Ps displays the current process(es) actively running in the system

96.	Default gateway is essentially a router routing traffic as an entry and exit point for data traffic between LAN and external networks
97.	Routing table ???
98.	TCP connection is more reliable, establishes connection before sending data, congestion and flow control
